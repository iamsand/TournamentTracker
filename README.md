# TournamentTracker
This is an Winforms application written in C# which creates and manages single elimination-style tournaments. Its functionalities include being able to create team members, create teams, create prizes, and also randomizes the rounds and matchups to create a working competitive tournament.

This is a project I worked on by following Tim Corey's [course on how to build a C# application from start to finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfWxdh-_k_4). 

Technologies used in this project include
* C#, .Net Framework, Nuget, Winforms
* Sql Server
* Textfile storage (save, manage, access)
